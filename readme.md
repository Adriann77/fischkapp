## Fischkapp - Flashcard Learning Application

### Overview

Fischkapp is a React/SCSS-based web application designed to replicate the concept of flashcards for learning purposes. The project focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and deleting flashcards. It incorporates smooth animations for flipping cards and is connected to both a third-party API for additional content and a backend for data storage.

The project has undergone comprehensive testing using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework. These tests cover various aspects of the application, including the creation, editing, and deletion of flashcards. Notably, the testing suite includes scenarios where users can successfully edit flashcards by clicking the "Save" button with non-empty edited values, as well as exit editing mode by clicking the "Cancel" button.

The testing process ensures the reliability and functionality of Fischkapp, validating that the user interactions and features perform as intended. The use of Jest allows for efficient and automated testing, contributing to the overall robustness of the application.
